# Inworld Generate Token

This example project contains a server that uses the Inworld API Key and Secret to generate an authorization token to access Inworld.

It's important to note that this service is easily run on localhost or on a non-ssl based production server. If you use SSL or HTTPS you will need to follow the [SSL/HTTPS Server Setup](#server-setup) documentation.

## SSL/HTTPS Server Setup <a id="server-setup" name="server-setup"></a>

Do to modern security requirements for browsers, if you run the Inworld Web SDK from an external or Production service that uses SSL/HTTPS you will need to setup the this project on a service that can allow HTTPS OR you need a SSL Key/Certificate. 

Heroku is a known service that allows for automatic SSL/HTTPS services.

If you have your own SSL Key/Certificate you will need to setup this service the following way.

In you `.env` file you've setup previously, change the `USE_SSL` field to `true`. Copy your ssl key and certificate to the `./keys` folder found at the root of this project. In the `.env` file update the `SSL_KEY_NAME` and `SSL_CERT_NAME` fields to reflect the names of those files you copied. 

When you run this project using `yarn start` it should now be using SLL on the domain name the SSL keys were created for.
